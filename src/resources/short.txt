######  INTERFACE   #####

ADAPTER = WRAPPER
provide the interface that the "client" required using a class with a different "interface"

FACADE
One class has a method that performs a complex process calling several other classes

COMPOSITE
Assemble groups of objects with the same signature

BRIDGE
An abstraction and implementation are in different class hierarchies.


#########################
####  RESPONSIBILITY  ###

OBSERVER
a (1,n) link between an object that notifies others objects that it's changing

MEDIATOR
encapsulates the way objects interact with each other without creating a concrete link

PROXY
One class controls the "creation of" and "access to" objects in another class

CHAIN OF RESPONSIBILITY
A method called in one class will move up a class hierarchy until a method is found that can properly handle the call.

FLYWEIGHT
The reusable and variable parts of a class are split into two classes to save resources.


#########################
#####  CONSTRUCTION  ####

SINGLETON
Ensure that a class could be instantiates only once !

BUILDER
extract the instantiation algorithm from the object to the builder

FACTORY METHOD
permit to another coder to define the instantiation interface while keeping the choice on which class to instantiate (iterator)

ABSTRACT FACTORY = KIT
An abstract factory has sets of methods to make families of various objects.

PROTOTYPE
Make new objects by cloning the objects which you set as prototypes

MEMENTO = TOKEN
One object stores another objects state.


#########################
#####  OPERATIONS   #####

TEMPLATE = "Don't call us, we'll call you"
An abstract class defines various methods, and has one non-overridden method which calls the various methods.

STATE
distributing the logic related on the state of the object through different classes each representing a specific state

STRATEGY = POLICY
An object controls which of a family of methods is called. Each method is in its' own class that extends a common base class.

COMMAND = ACTION = TRANSACTION
An object encapsulates everything needed to execute a method in another object.

INTERPRETER
Define a macro language and syntax, parsing input into objects which perform the correct opertaions.


#########################
######  EXTENSIONS  #####

DECORATOR
One class takes in another class, both of which extend the same abstract class, and adds functionality.

ITERATOR = CURSOR
One object can traverse all of the elements of another object.

VISITOR
One or more related classes have the same method, which calls a method specific for themselves in another class.
