Software application conception remains link to the coders experience and coding-style :
 * Oriented Object Principle (encapsulation, heritage and polymorphism) are not sufficient
 * design patterns define high levels good practices but are not linked to generate a whole consistent and coherent

=> but it exists som Design Principle to complete these tools

The 3 main risks that counter the development activity :
  RIGIDITY : each evolution could impact a large parts of the application
  => development cost more and more
  => because development on the software is expansive there are less and less developments on it
  =>...

  FRAGILITY : modifying a part of the software could generate some fail-over on another part
  => the software is not robust and running activity is expansive
  => because developing on the software is risky there xill be less and less evolution on it

  IMMOBILITY : it sounds crazy to try to extract a part of the code to reuse it in another one
  => the initial cost of new software remains high because each time you have to restart from scratch

  ! Larger is the software, more visible are these problems !



A GOOD DESIGN WILL TENDS TO BE :
  ROBUST = changes don't introduce regressions !
  EXTENSIBILITY = it's easy to add new features
  REUSEABILITY = we could reuse some parts to construct another software

3 PRACTICES TO INTEGRATE TO YOUR DESIGN

1- OPEN-CLOSE PRINCIPLE (OCP)
"EVERY MODULE (package, classes, methods) MUST BE OPEN TO EXTENSION BUT MUST BE CLOSED TO MODIFICATION !"
  => the module must be extends to add a behavior not provided
  => the extends are injected without modifying the module's code

2- LISKOV SUBSTITUTION PRINCIPLE (LSP)
The class of reference is an "interface" extracted from all sub-classes
=! heritage is a factorization of common code

The perfect substitution ?
  It's not always possible so it means two options :
  1- don't change the "interface" and use a "downcast" were necessary
  => violation of the OCP
  2- expend the interface to integrate uncommon signature which mean force sub-classes to implement some empty methods
  => violation of the LSP

  Prefer the first solution because the issue remains were it appears and is not diffused into the code.

3- DEPENDENCY INVERSION PRINCIPLE (DIP)
